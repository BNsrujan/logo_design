# Animated Logo Designs

This repository contains two animated logo designs created using pure HTML and CSS.

## Logo 1: Akki Logo

The Akki logo is a modern, geometric design created using CSS shapes and transforms. Here's a breakdown of its implementation:

### Structure
- The logo is built using multiple `<span>` elements that are positioned absolutely
- The main container has a class `.akki` with dimensions of 108rem Ã— 127rem
- The design uses a combination of skewed rectangles and triangles to create a dynamic shape

### Key Features
- Uses CSS variables for consistent colors:
  - `--bg-color: #00b6ff` (main blue color)
  - `--bg-background-hiding: #000000` (black for hiding elements)
- Implements complex layering using z-index
- Uses CSS transforms (skew, translate) for precise positioning
- Creates depth using box-shadows
- Responsive design using rem units

### Main Components
1. Left and right main sections (skewed rectangles)
2. Center arrow structure
3. Center triangle with hiding elements
4. Below section with additional geometric shapes

### CSS Techniques Used
- Absolute positioning
- CSS transforms (skew, translate)
- Box shadows for depth
- Z-index layering
- Overflow handling
- CSS variables for theming
